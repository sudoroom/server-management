### You may add configuration parameters here, see spamass-milter(1)
###
### Note that the -x option for expanding aliases and virtusertable entries
### only works if spamass-milter is run as root; you will need to use
### spamass-milter-root.service instead of spamass-milter.service if you
### wish to do this but otherwise it's best to run as the unprivileged user
### sa-milt by using the normal spamass-milter.service
